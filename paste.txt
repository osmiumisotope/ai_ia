This is a good draft. Here are the changes I want you to make in this plan:

For clients table: 
Instead of age, we'll use date of birth. 
Remove dependents column
Add another column called : primary flag. We'll use this to define whether a user is primary or a dependent. 
Add another column : Primary UUID. This will contain the UUID of primary holder for a dependent. 
Add column: Gender assigned at birth. This is required so that we can use correct projections for life expectancy

The structure of asset_snapshot doesn't seem right to me. I think it's better to create it like this: 
Schema Name: ACCOUNTS
Table: HOLDINGS
Description: This table has mapping of all the current holdings of an account 
Columns: Security Identifier, quantity, account_id

TABLE: ACCOUNT_OWNER
Description: This table holds the mapping for account owner and account id 
Columns: UUID, account_id, account type name

Table: ACCOUNT_TYPES 
Description: This table describes account characteristics. This does not contain user information or a specific account id information but is a description of account types in general
Columns: account type name, tax advantaged, roth, liquid

TRANSACTIONS:
Description: This is a ledger type account for cash expenses
Date
Type
Amount
Debit/Credit
Description

TABLE : DOCUMENTS:
Type:
File Name:
Hash:
Customer UID:
Upload Time:

For goals table we need to allocate accounts to them as well. So add columns which will help with that. 

Goal progress history table is not required. We need to show current values and historical values don't matter.
